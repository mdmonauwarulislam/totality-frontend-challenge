# Totality Frontend Challenge - Property Rental Platform

This project is a property rental platform developed using React, designed to showcase property listings, enable users to manage bookings, and provide a seamless checkout experience. The platform also includes responsive design to ensure compatibility across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

### 1. Property Listings
- Display a variety of properties with details such as:
  - Images
  - Titles
  - Descriptions
  - Prices
  - "Book Now" buttons
- Filters allow users to sort properties by:
  - Location
  - Price Range
  - Number of Bedrooms
  - Amenities

### 2. Booking Management
- Users can book properties and manage them in a cart.
- Booking cart displays:
  - Property details
  - Booking dates
  - Total cost
- Users can:
  - Increase or decrease booked properties
  - Remove properties from the cart
  - See real-time updates for total cost and booking count

### 3. Checkout Process
- A streamlined checkout process that:
  - Calculates the total cost of booked properties
  - Allows users to enter booking and payment details (contact information and payment details)

### 4. Responsive Design
- Fully responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The layout adapts dynamically based on screen size, providing an optimal user experience across devices.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- **User Authentication (Optional)**: 
  - Users can register and log in.
  - Display the userâ€™s name and avatar when logged in.


## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and utility-first CSS framework.
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests.
  
### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manage state for authentication and booking management.

### Hosting
- **Vercel/Netlify**: The application is deployed on Vercel/Netlify for production.

## Approach

1. **UI Design**: I focused on creating a user-friendly and clean UI, ensuring that the platform is easy to navigate. The layout and components are designed with responsiveness in mind to provide a seamless experience on all devices.
2. **Property Listings**: I implemented a component-based architecture where each property is rendered dynamically from an array of property data, including images, descriptions, prices, etc. Filtering options were added to make it easy for users to sort through listings.
3. **Booking Management**: For booking management, I used Redux to store and update the cart's state efficiently. Users can add, remove, or update bookings with real-time feedback on the total cost.
4. **Checkout Process**: A multi-step form was created to guide users through the checkout process. Each step validates the input data to ensure a smooth transaction.
5. **Authentication (Optional)**: Users can register and log in, and upon successful login, their name and avatar will be displayed.
